## How to install
1. Install [*node-red-contrib-mytimeout*](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-mytimeout) & [*node-red-contrib-moment*](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-moment)

2. Download the flow, then go to your node-red application and press **`import`** > **`cliboard`** and finally select the file downloaded.
   Two versions available:
   * [flowEN.json](flowEN.json) --> English language
   * [flowIT.json](flowIT.json) --> Italian language

3. Modify the *Properties* **Server** (ex: Home Assistant) and **Entity Id** (ex: climate.termostato) of the following nodes:
   * Climate
   * Away from Alarm
   * svc: climate:set_temperature
   * svc: climate:turn_off
   * svc: climate:turn_on

   These nodes are highlighted in the flow by the comment *"Set this"* (![set_this image](screenshots/set_this.png)).
